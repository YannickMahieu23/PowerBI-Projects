### Space Missions ###

This Power BI Dashboard showcases a simple yet straigforward analysis of Space Mission Data.
The dashboard is designed to offer a visually appealing and interactive experience, allowing users to explore 
key metrics, trends, and details related to space missions answering questions such as:

How have rocket launches trended across time? Has mission success rate increased?

Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?

Which rocket has been used for the most space missions?

This dataset contains a csv table with 4,631 records, one for each space mission between 1957-10-04 and 2022-07-29.
Each record contains details on each mission's name, location, date, and status of the launch, the company responsible, 
and the price, status, and name of the rocket.

The above dataset is provided as a part of a Maven Analytics Challenge in 2022.
