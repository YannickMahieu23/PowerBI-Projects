### Space Missions ###

I believe that outer space has more to offer than humanity can currently imagine. I also believe that
human natural curiousity will try and find a way to slowly reveal its mysteries.

The beginning of human spaceflight is one such steps as to explore outer space and extent our knowledge.
For those, like me, who like to understand the history of human spaceflight, 
browsing through decades of spaceflight data leaves you wonder what more is out there.
We just have to make it so.

This Power BI Dashboard showcases a simple yet straigforward analysis of Space Mission Data,
relating to questions such as:

Who are the major spacefairing countries? Has it always been that way?
Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has mission success rate increased?
Which rocket has been used for the most space missions?

The dashboard is designed to offer a visually appealing and interactive experience, allowing users to explore 
key metrics, trends, and details related to space missions.

The dataset contains a csv table with 4,631 records, one for each space mission between 1957-10-04 and 2022-07-29.
Each record contains details on each mission's name, location, date, and status of the launch, the company responsible, 
and the price, status, and name of the rocket.

The above dataset is provided as a part of a Maven Analytics Challenge in 2022.
